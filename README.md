# Machine-Learning-for-Everybody
In the MAGIC.ipynb, we used magic dataset from uci and applied different machine learning algorithms on the same data e.g. KNN, logistic regression, support vector machine and neural networks.
In the bike-regression.ipynb, we used seoul bikes dataset and applied linear regression first from simple linear regression and then applied linear regression using neural networks.
In the seeds-unsupervised.ipynb, we used seeds dataset from uci and applied different unsupervised machine learning algorithms like K Means clustering to identify clusters in the given data and principle component analysis to reduce all the dimensions to a component dimension.
